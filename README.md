# Undergraduate-Learning-Assistant
As an Undergraduate Learning Assistant at The George Washington University, I played a pivotal role in instructing calculus-based mechanics and electromechanics to undergraduate students enrolled in Phys 1011, 1012, 1021, and 1022. My responsibilities extended beyond traditional teaching, encompassing a diverse range of pedagogical strategies to foster a dynamic and inclusive learning environment.

I completed coursework in pedagogy with a particular focus on SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs) learning, which emphasizes interactive and inclusive classroom management. This training equipped me with innovative teaching techniques to engage students actively and create a collaborative learning atmosphere.

One of my key contributions was developing the skill of asking targeted questions to enhance student comprehension of complex topics. By carefully crafting questions, I was able to guide students through challenging concepts, encouraging them to think critically and deepen their understanding.

During lectures, I engaged in hands-on problem-solving with students, reinforcing their learning through practical application. This approach not only solidified their grasp of the material but also helped them develop problem-solving skills essential for their academic and professional growth.

Overall, my experience as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant at The George Washington University has honed my teaching abilities and reinforced my commitment to fostering an engaging and supportive learning environment for all students.
